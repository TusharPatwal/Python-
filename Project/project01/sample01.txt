You Are a Genius
If a genius is someone with exceptional abilities and the insight to find the not so
obvious solution to a problem, you don’t need to win a Nobel Prize to be one. A
genius looks at something that others are stuck on and gets the world unstuck.
So the question is: Have you ever done that?
Have you ever found a shortcut that others couldn’t find?
Solved a problem that confounded your family?
Seen a way to make something work that wasn’t working before?
Made a personal connection with someone who was out of reach to everyone
else?
Even once?
No one is a genius all the time. Einstein had trouble finding his house when he
walked home from work every day. But all of us are geniuses sometimes.
The tragedy is that society (your school, your boss, your government, your
family) keeps drumming the genius part out. The problem is that our culture has
engaged in a Faustian bargain, in which we trade our genius and artistry for
apparent stability.
