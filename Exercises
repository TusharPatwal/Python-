# Exercise 1: Accept numbers from a user
# Write a program to accept two numbers from the user and calculate multiplication

Number1 = int(input("Write the first value : "))
Number2 = int(input("Write the second value : "))
Product = Number1 * Number2
print(Product)


# Exercise 2: Display three string “Name”, “Is”, “James” as “Name**Is**James”
# Use the print() function to format the given words in the mentioned format. Display the ** separator between each string.

print('Name', 'Is', 'James', sep='**')


# Exercise 3: Convert Decimal number to Binary using print() output formatting
# Given: num = 8
# Expected Output: The binary number of decimal number 8 is 1000

num = int(input("Give the value: "))
print(bin(num))


# Exercise 4: Python program to check whether the given number is even or not.

num = int(input("Enter the number: "))
x = int(num) % 2

if num == 0:
    print("The number is neither even nor odd.")
elif x == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
    

# Exercise 5: Python program to convert the temperature in degree centigrade to Fahrenheit
# Formula: (0°C × 9/5) + 32 = 32°F

centigrade = int(input("Enter the value: "))
fahrenheit = (centigrade * 9/5) + 32
print("Value in Fahrenheit: ", fahrenheit)


#Exercise 6: Python program to find the area of a triangle whose sides are given

import math
a = float(input("Enter the length of side a: "))
b = float(input("Enter the length of side b: "))
c = float(input("Enter the length of side c: "))
s = (a+b+c)/2
area = math.sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))
print(" Area of the triangle is: ", area)


#Exercise 7: Python program to find out the average of a set of integers

count = int(input("Enter the count of numbers: "))
i = 0
sum = 0
for i in range(count):
    x = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
    sum = sum + x
avg = sum/count
print(" The average is: ", avg)


#Exercise 8: Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
year = 2022 - age + 100
print(f"{name} your age will turn 100 years in {year}")


# Exercise 9: Take a list, say for example this one: a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 4, 3, 2, 80, 8, 9]
for i in a:
    if i < 5:
        print(f"{i} is smaller than 5")
        
        
# Exercise 10: Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.

num = int(input("Enter the value: "))
listrange = list(range(1, num+1))
divisor = []
for i in listrange:
    if num % i == 0:
        divisor.append(i)
print(divisor)


# Exercise 11: Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

string = input("Enter the string: ")
palindrome = string[::-1]
if string == palindrome:
    print("This word is a Palindrome.")
else:
    print("This word is not a Palindrome.")


# Exercise 12: Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one code of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
new_a = []
for i in a:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        new_a.append(i)
print(new_a)
