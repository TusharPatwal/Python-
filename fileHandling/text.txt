Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code. 
Jupyter (formerly IPython Notebook) is an open-source project 
that lets you easily combine Markdown text and executable 
Python source code on one canvas called a notebook. 
Visual Studio Code supports working with 
Jupyter Notebooks natively, and through Python code files.
